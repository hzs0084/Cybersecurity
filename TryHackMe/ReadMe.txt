These are the rooms that I have worked on TryHackMe

I am not taking screenshot or explaining why I did those things, that information is already out there but what I am doing is streamlining that information in one place so that anyone or even I can look back on without googling it. 

There are going to be links to the tasks that were worked on by people with detailed explaination and I am not taking credit for any of the work they did.
